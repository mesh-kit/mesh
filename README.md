# mesh

A lightweight, distributed, command-based WebSocket framework for real-time applications.

Mesh coordinates connections, rooms, presence, and shared state across distributed instances using Redis — with built-in support for structured commands, presence tracking, versioned data sync, pub/sub channels with optional persistence, and automatic reconnection.
